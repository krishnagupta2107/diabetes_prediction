## 📌 Overview

The **Diabetes Prediction Web Application** is a machine learning–based system that predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on key health parameters.  
It uses a trained classification model integrated with a Flask web application to provide **real-time predictions** through a simple and user-friendly interface.

This project demonstrates the **end-to-end machine learning workflow**, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
